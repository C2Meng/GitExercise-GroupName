Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He takes a bath.
He has breakfast.
Then he checked Instagram.
He goes to class.
Adam found his crush staring at him.
His heart throbs rapidly.

    He then approaches her.
    Cold sweats flows behind his back.

    He was about to say hi.
    But the teacher came in.

Adam's heart sank.
He needs to think of a new plan.
